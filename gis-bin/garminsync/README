How to use
==========

In order to use this program you need to have (at least) PyUSB and
ElementTree installed. You also need to make sure that the garmin_gps
*is not loaded*, so do this after you've connected your GPS to make
sure it's not loaded:

    sudo modprobe -r garmin_gps

After this you should be able to download data from your Forerunner or
Edge that are connected via USB, by executing garmin-sync without any
arguments:

    ./garmin-sync

If you get permission complaints, try running it with root privileges.

    sudo ./garmin-sync

This should print out a message saying that it's downloading data from
the GPS, and also export all runs into a TCX format in the 'exports'
directory. There will be one file per run.

This software is experimental at the moment, so don't expect it to work
all the time. If you get an error, try running it again. If you still
get an error, try unplug and reconnect your GPS and try running it
again.
